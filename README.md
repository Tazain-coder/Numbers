# Numbers
Welcome to the "Ternary Number Converter in Python" repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and files designed to facilitate the conversion of ternary numbers. Ternary numbers are base-3 numeral systems, similar to binary (base-2) and decimal (base-10) systems, but they use only three digits (0, 1, and 2).

Ternary-to-Decimal Conversion: Easily convert ternary numbers to their decimal equivalents, making mathematical operations and comparisons more accessible.

Decimal-to-Ternary Conversion: Perform the reverse conversion, converting decimal numbers into ternary form.

Arithmetic Operations: Execute arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ternary numbers.

Input Validation: Robust input validation to ensure accurate and error-free conversions.

Interactive User Interface: Some scripts may include interactive user interfaces for a more user-friendly experience.
