# Numbers
Welcome to the "Ternary Number Converter in Python" repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and files designed to facilitate the conversion of ternary numbers. Ternary numbers are base-3 numeral systems, similar to binary (base-2) and decimal (base-10) systems, but they use only three digits (0, 1, and 2).
